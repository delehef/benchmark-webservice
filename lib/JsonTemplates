#    Assessment datasets should be generated in the METRICS COMPUTATION step
#    The minimal required properties for this dataset are:
#    - community - the benchmarking community name/OEB-id
#    - challenge - the challenge where the metrics were computed
#    - participant_id - name/OEB-id of the tool which is evaluated in this assessment
#    - metric - the name of the unique metric which correspond to this assessment
#    - metric_value - the numeric value of the metric
#    - error - the standard error/deviation for the computed metric (can be 0)
#    - ID - the id assigned to this dataset by the community (this will 
#           be determined by the arguments automatically)


AssessmentDataset := proc(community, challenge, participant_id, metric, metric_value, metric_error)
    id_ := sprintf('%s:%s_%s_%s_A', community, challenge, metric, participant_id);
    metrics := table():
    metrics['metric_id'] := metric;
    metrics['value'] := metric_value;
    metrics['stderr'] := metric_error;
    data := table():
